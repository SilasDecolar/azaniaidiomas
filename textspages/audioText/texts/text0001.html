            <p>Monday January 8</p>
            <p>
                Dear diary, Every Monday, it's the same thing. My alarm goes off at six thirty, I go back to sleep
                for
                fifteen more minutes, and I get up around six forty-five. Then I take my shower to finish waking up.
            </p>
            <p>
                After, I go into the kitchen and drink my coffee. Sometimes, like this morning, I have croissants
                leftover from the weekend, otherwise I eat buttered toats. I am not very hungry in the
                morning, even though I know it's the most important meal of the day. I also take advantage of breakfast
                to read the news online.
            </p>
            <p>
                Usually that's when I realize I'm late! I run to my room, and hurry to get dressed and put on makeup,
                then I'm going to take the subway!
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe I should wake up a little earlier to avoid that! Yes, dear Diary, it's decided, next Monday, I
                will
                set my alarm earlier!
