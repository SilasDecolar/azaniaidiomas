            <p>Reporter: Okay, let's start the interview. Hello what is your name?</p>

            <p>The vampire: Hello, my name is Louis from Pointe du Lac.</p>

            <p>Reporter: How old are you?</p>

            <p>The Vampire: I am two hundred and forty-eight years old, but I am forever twenty-five.</p>

            <p>The journalist: But that's impossible!</p>

            <p>The vampire: Yes, it's possible: I'm a vampire.</p>

            <p>The journalist: Thatâ€™s extraordinary! What's your birthday?</p>

            <p>The Vampire: I have two dates of birth. I was born on October 10, 1766. And I was also born on August
                21,
                1791 as a vampire.</p>

            <p>Reporter: Where are you from?</p>

            <p>The Vampire: I'm from New Orleans, in the southern United States.</p>

            <p>Reporter: So, you are American?</p>

            <p>The Vampire: Yes, I am American by origin, but as a vampire I have no country.</p>

            <p>Reporter: Where do you live now?</p>

            <p>The Vampire: I've been living here in San Francisco for a few weeks. But I will not stay long.</p>

            <p>Journalist: Do you have children?</p>

            <p>The Vampire: Yes, I have an only daughter, Claudia.</p>

            <p>Journalist: And do you have a pet?</p>

            <p>The Vampire: No, I don't have a pet, because I eat animals.</p>

            <p>The journalist: Oh okay!</p>

            <p>The Vampire: Excuse me, how are you?</p>

            <p>Journalist: Me? Um... I'm fine. I'm very surprised but it's okay!</p>

            <p>The Vampire: Very good.</p>

            <p>The journalist: And what do you do for a living then?</p>

            <p>The Vampire: Not much. I live at night, I eat and I hide.</p>

            <p>Journalist: That's sad!</p>

            <p>The Vampire: Yes, it's very depressing. I will go now.</p>

            <p>The journalist: Oh okay. See you soon then?</p>

            <p>The Vampire: Maybe... goodbye.</p>

            <p>Journalist: Goodbye.</p>
